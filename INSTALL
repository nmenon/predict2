INSTALL
----------------------

This project is still in the development stage 
So I should ought to tell ye  not to install and run this. IT WILL NOT WORK

but to compile is easy-
set the class paths properly and the go to src/PredictII and the /src/webby directory and run 'make java'.

create the DB tables - as in my Final Report please! User Names are present in the conf/ directory in the src/PredictII directory. Edit it as needed.
